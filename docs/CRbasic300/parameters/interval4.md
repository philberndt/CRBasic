# Interval (Write Options)

Determines whether the instruction will write files based on a specified number of records or on a time interval. If Interval is set to 0, files will be written once a specified number of records is available in the datalogger's data table. If Interval has a non-zero value, files will be written based on a time interval (which is determined by using three parameters: TimeIntoInterval, Interval, and Units).
