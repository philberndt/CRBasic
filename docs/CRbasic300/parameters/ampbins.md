# AmpBins (Amplitude Bins)

The number of columns or fields to parse the amplitude of the stress/strain cycle into. The range of each Amp column is equal to the HiLim minus the LoLim divided by the AmpBin's value. The lowest Amp column s minimum boundary is zero and the highest Amp column s maximum boundary is the HiLim minus the LoLim.

Type: Constant (or expression that evaluates as a constant)
