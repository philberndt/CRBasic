# KnownVar (Known Variable)

The KnownVar parameter is a variable array that holds the set point value(s) to be used in the calibration routine. 0 can be entered when performing a Zero calibration. When performing any other calibration function, the KnownVar must be dimensioned to the same size as the MeasureVar. The element of the array used for the first calibration is set by the Index parameter.
