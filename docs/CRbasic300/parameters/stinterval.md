# STInterval (Time between Self-Timed Transmissions)

Used to define the time between self-timed transmissions. The value is a constant string entered in the format of "Days_Hours_Minutes_Seconds". Typically the assigned interval is in hours, so the days, minutes and seconds parameters are left at 0 (example, "0_1_0_0" sets up an hourly interval). Maximum interval is 14 days; minimum interval is 5 minutes.
