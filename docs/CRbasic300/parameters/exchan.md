# ExChan (Excitation Channel)

Specifies theexcitationterminal to use to excite the first measurement. If the Reps parameter is greater than 1, the excitation terminal used for subsequent measurements will be incremented with each measurement based on the MeasPEx parameter.

When a series of sensors are measured with the same instruction, the Meas/Ex parameter is used to determine how many sensors to excite with one excitation terminal before advancing to the next.

An alphanumeric code is entered. Right-click within the parameter to display a list.

| Alphanumeric | Description          |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| VX1          | Excitation channel 1 |
| VX2          | Excitation channel 2 |

Type: Constant
