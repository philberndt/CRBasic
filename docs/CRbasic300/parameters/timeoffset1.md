# TimeOffset (Time Offset)

The local time offset, in seconds, from UTC. If the datalogger setting "UTC Offset" is a value other than -1 (disabled), this offset will be ignored and the UTC Offset value will be used. This parameter can be used to keep the datalogger clock set to local time when the DNP3 master is sending time synchronization commands to the datalogger, which are in UTC.

Type: Constant or Variable
