# Index

If Reps is set to 1, then Index specifies which element of the MeasureVar array will be calibrated. If Reps is set to the size of the MeasureVar, then Index must be set equal to 1 (complete array will be calibrated starting with the first element). This parameter can be a constant or a variable. It must be initialized to a non-zero value before a calibration can be performed.

Type: Constant or Variable
