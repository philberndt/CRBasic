# Pressure (Air Pressure Value)

The program variable that contains the value for the air pressure sensor. The air pressure measurement must be in kilopascals. If an air pressure sensor is not available, for most applications a constant pressure value for the site can be used without significantly affecting the resulting vapor pressure calculation.

Type: Variable or Constant
