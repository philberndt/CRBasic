# MeanBins (Mean Bins)

The number of rows or fields to parse the stress/strain cycle's mean value into. Enter 1 to disregard the mean value and sort only by the amplitude of the stress/strain cycle. The range of each row of bins is equal to the UpLimit minus the LoLimit divided by the MeanBin's value. The lowest mean row s minimum boundary is the LoLim and the highest mean row s maximum boundary is the UpLim.

Type: Constant (or expression that evaluates as a constant)
