# Origin_Description

A quoted string containing a comma-separated list of field origin descriptors. Colons can be used to indicate hierarchical levels within the same field origin. When using arrays, if the quoted string lacks sufficient entries, any unspecified values will inherit the origin of the last specified entry.
