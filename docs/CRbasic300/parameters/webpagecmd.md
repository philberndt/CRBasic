# WebPageCmd (Incoming Web Command)

A string that holds the incoming command from the web browser, which the datalogger will subsequently parse. The string needs to be sized large enough to accommodate any command that might be received.

Commands can be passed from the web page to the datalogger, which the datalogger will then parse and act upon (all commands after the "?" are parsed). Commands that are supported natively by the operating system are:

Level 2 must be unlocked to set a variable in the Public table, and level 1 just be unlocked to set a value in the Status table. The datalogger is also capable of basic web authentication using the datalogger Account Manager. This is the preferred method of securing the datalogger when it is acting as an HTTP server. |

Note that these commands also can be used directly in a URL to the datalogger without having a web page in the datalogger. For example, the following typed into a URL will set a variable in the datalogger:

http://192.168.4.14/?command = SetValue&table = public&field = SetPoint&value = 70.2

Type: String Variable
