# BaudRate (Baud Rate)

The BaudRate parameter is used to set the rate, in bps, for communication. The options are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. Selecting one of these options fixes the baud rate at that rate of communication

Note: Autobaud is not available on this datalogger.
