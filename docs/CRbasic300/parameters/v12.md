# V12

V12 parameter can be used to either write the state of the 12V relay or read the state of the 12V relay (opened or closed).

With the mask parameter set to Write, writing a 0 in the 12V parameter opens the 12V relay. Writing a 1 to the Vp parameter closes the 12V relay. The closed relay connects the 12V input to 12V output and is capable of passing up to 5A of current.

With the mask set to Read, reading a 0 from the 12V parameter means the SIO2R is commanding the 12V relay to be open. Reading a 1 from the 12V parameter means the relay is being commanded to be closed. Note: This only reads the commanded state not the actual state. The relay contacts could permanently fail in closed or opened positions.
