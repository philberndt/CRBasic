# Speed/East (Wind Speed or East Direction)

Enter the source variable for the wind speed (for a polar sensor) or East direction (for an orthogonal sensor). If Reps is greater than 1, this parameter must be an array dimensioned large enough to accommodate the repetitions. This parameter is ignored at compile time when OutputOpt 3 or 4 is used. However, a wind speed variable that is dimensioned to at least the number of repetitions in the instruction must be entered or a compile error will result.
