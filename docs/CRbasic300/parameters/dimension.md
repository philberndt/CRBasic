# Dimension

An optional parameter that is used to specify the dimension to perform the sort on, in a multi-dimensional array. Valid options are:

- **1 **: Sort on the first dimension of the array (for example, sort on X in Array (X,Y)). This is the default behavior if Dimension is not specified.

- ** 2 **: Sort on the second dimension of the array (for example, sort on Y in Array(X,Y)).

- ** 3**: Sort on the third dimension of the array (for example, sort on Z in Array(X,Y,Z)).

Type: Constant
