# TimeIntoInterval (Time into Interval)

The TimeIntoInterval parameter is used along with the Interval parameter to provide a time to the destination dataloggers by which they all must communicate. The TimeIntoInterval is essentially a maximum offset for the interval parameter (for example, if the interval is 60 seconds and the TimeIntoInterval is 15, communication should be completed by 15 seconds after the top of the minute, each minute). This value is entered in seconds.

Type: Constant
