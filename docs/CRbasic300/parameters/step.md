# Step

The step to be used when searching through the source. It is useful in specifying row or dimension when searching a two or three dimensional array.

Note that when Step is used, the value returned takes these "steps" into account. For instance, if a Step of 2 is used in a one dimensional array, a value that is found in the eighth element of an array will return a value of 4. If a Step of 1 was used, the returned value would be 8. Step values greater than one are more often used in multi-dimensional arrays
