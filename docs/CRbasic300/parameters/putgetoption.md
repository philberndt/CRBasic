# PutGetOption (Send or Receive a File)

Determines 1) whether the datalogger will send or retrieve a file, 2) whether active or passive mode is used, and 3) whether FTPorFTPS (FTP via TLS) is used.

Active vs. Passive mode

In active mode, the client initiates contact with the server and the server must connect back to the client on the port specified by the client. This response from the server may be blocked by the client s firewall. Passive mode resolves the issue of firewalls by having the client issue a PASV command that opens two random unprivileged ports to the server. In response to the PASV command from the client, the server sends a random port number back to the client. Finally, the client initiates a connection from the server via the port specified by the server. Not all servers support passive mode.

FTPS

The default server port forimplicitFTPS is 990. Otherwise,explicitsecurity is used. Implicit security automatically begins with an SSL connection as soon as the FTP client connects to an FTP server, whereas with explicit security, the client and server negotiate the level of protection used.

FTPS(TLS) requires an adjustment to the memory used by communication. A new pool of memory of size 53684 bytes is required. The PutGetOption governs this. If this option is variable, that is, not known at compile time, then enough memory is allocated to accommodate TLS.

Type: Variable
