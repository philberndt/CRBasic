# Instruction Panel

This portion of the CRBasic Editor's window is the Instruction Panel. When an instruction is highlighted and the **Insert** button is pressed, a Parameter window for that instruction will appear (if the instruction has no parameters, it is inserted directly into the program). Alternately, you can double-click the highlighted instructions.

If an instruction is highlighted and the **Help** button is pressed, help for that instruction is displayed.

The instruction panel can be resized by hovering the mouse cursor over the window's left border until the resizing symbol appears, and dragging that border right or left to the desired size.
