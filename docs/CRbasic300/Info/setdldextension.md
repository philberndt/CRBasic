# Set Datalogger Type

| The CRBasic Editor displays instruction lists and help files based on the type of datalogger file opened. The compiler used when a program is compiled is also based on the datalogger type. Often, the help files and compiler are set based upon a specific datalogger extension (for example, \*.CR1X or \*.CR6). However, if a program file has a [generic program extension](Program%20File%20Extension.md)(for example, .DLD or .CRB), the datalogger type must be selected in the 'Set Datalogger Type' dialog box (**Tools | Set Datalogger Type)**. |

Within the 'Set Datalogger Type' dialog box, select a datalogger type and then click OK. If you are writing a program that uses [conditional compilation](conditionalcompilation.md), you can select one datalogger type and compile the program and then select a second datalogger type and compile the program (thus checking the code for both dataloggers).
