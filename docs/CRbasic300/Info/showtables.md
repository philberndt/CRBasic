# Show Tables

Display a list of tables in the program along with the output interval (if known), a list of field names, and units for each variable if they have been assigned for each table. If desired, the information in the window can be selected and copied to the Windows clipboard, then pasted into the CRBasic program or another document.

The program must be saved before table information can be displayed.
