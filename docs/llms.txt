# CRBasic documentation â€” top-level index

> Top-level llms index for the CRBasic documentation set. This file provides quick, LLM-friendly entry points to each datalogger series' curated `llms.txt` and points to companion enumerator files when present.

This folder (`docs/`) contains series-specific subfolders (for example `CRbasic350/`) each with a per-series `llms.txt`. Use the per-series `llms.txt` files as entry points for automated ingestion or as a human-friendly index.

## Series

- [CRbasic1x llms (CRBasic 1.x)](./CRbasic1x/llms.txt)
- [CRbasic300 llms (CRBasic 3.00)](./CRbasic300/llms.txt)
- [CRbasic350 llms (CRBasic 3.50)](./CRbasic350/llms.txt)

## Repository README

- [Repository README (overview & guidance)](../README.md)

## Validation & tooling

- Per-series `llms.txt` files may link to companion enumerator files named `instructions-llms.txt` and `parameters-llms.txt` for exhaustive lists.
## Optional

- If you want more aggressive context generation for LLM ingestion, run a tool such as `llms_txt2ctx` against the per-series `llms.txt` to expand linked docs into a single LLM context file.
