# SatVP Over Ice

The saturation vapor pressure over ice (SVPI), in kilopascals, for the temperature range of -50 degrees C to 0 degrees C is found with this relationship:

SVPI = A0 + A1 \* X + A2 \* X2

where

A0 = -0.00486

A1 = 0.85471

A2 = 0.2441

and X is the saturation vapor pressure found with the SatVP instruction. This relationship is derived by Campbell Scientific, Inc., from the equations for the saturation vapor pressure over water and ice given in Lowe's paper.
