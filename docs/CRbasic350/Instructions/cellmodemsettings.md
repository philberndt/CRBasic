# Cellular Modem Settings

The following table demonstrates the proper syntax for some common cellular modem settings that may be set programmatically using the [SetSetting](setstatussetsetting.md) instruction. These settings may also be set usingDevice Configuration Utility

**Note:** Configuration tool used to set up dataloggers and peripherals, and to configure PakBus settings before those devices are deployed in the field and/or added to networks.
