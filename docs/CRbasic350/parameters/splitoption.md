| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | NUMERIC Numeric values are split out of the SearchString and stored into the array. Non-numeric characters are discarded. Delimiters are any characters but + - . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 E). With this option, FilterString is ignored.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1    | NON-NUMERIC Non-numeric sub-strings (text strings) are split out of the SearchString and stored into the array. Numeric characters are discarded. Delimiters are . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 E). With this option, FilterString is ignored.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2    | SEARCHSTRING - SearchString is split and stored into the array based upon the occurrence of the entire FilterString.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3    | SEARCHCHARS - SearchString is split and stored into the array based upon each occurrence of any character that is in FilterString.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4    | HEADERFILTER - Any string succeeding FilterString is returned in SplitResult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5    | FOOTERFILTER -The number of values specified are parsed from the SearchString using the FilterString, or until the end of the SearchString is reached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6    | HEADERFILTERCHARS - Strings succeeding any character in the FilterString char list are returned in SplitResult. Redundant delimiters are treated as a single delimiter; for example, a string of AA BB CC with a Header Filter of (space) will be returned as AA BB CC . In addition, multiple delimiters can be specified; for example, :; will split a string based on the colon or semicolon. |
| 7    | FOOTERFILTERCHARS - Strings preceding any character in the FilterString char list are returned in SplitResult. Redundant delimiters are treated as a single delimiter. In addition, multiple delimiters can be specified; for example, :; will split a string based on the colon or semicolon.                                                                                                   |
| 8    | NUMERICHEX - SearchString is split and stored in the array based upon the occurrence of hexadecimal numerics in the string (delimiters are any character but 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 A B C D E F). The hexadecimal value is stored in the array. With this option, FilterString is ignored.                                                                                                        |
| 1x   | Where X is one of the options above, right justify the resultant array, filling vacant elements withNAN **Note:** Not a number. A data word indicating a measurement or processing error. Voltage overrange, SDI-12 sensor error, and undefined mathematical results can produce NAN. (if numeric) or a NULL string if a string.                                                                 |

For option 5, if a null string exists between two filter strings, a null string will be returned. For option 7, any null strings will be ignored.

Add 100 to any of the non-numeric options above to parse a string that includes quotes, with the quotes being omitted in the result.
