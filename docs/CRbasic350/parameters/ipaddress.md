# IPAddress (IP Address)

The IP address for the device you are trying to send a file to or retrieve a file from. This is a string expression, which can be entered as a numeric address (for example, "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", with each xxx being a value of 0 to 255) or a fully-qualified domain name (for example, "computer-name.domain.com"). FTP URL syntax (for example, ftp://server.com) should not be used. The default port number used is 21. If a different port number is required, follow the IPAddress with a colon and enter the port number (for example, 192.168.3.45:35).
