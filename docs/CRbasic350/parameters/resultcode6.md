# ResultCode (Result Code)

The ResultCode is the variable in which a response code for the transmission will be stored. A zero indicates a successful transaction. A positive value indicates that there was no response to the request from the remote. A negative value indicates some other type of error occurred. The codes that can be returned are:

| 1, 2..n | The number of timeouts waiting for a response. The value will increment with each successive failure. After a 0 or negative response, the value will start over at 1.                                                           |
