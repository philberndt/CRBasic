# BaudRate (Data Transmit Rate)

The rate, in bps, at which data is transmitted. The options are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. Selecting one of these options fixes the baud rate at that rate of communication.

**NOTE:** This datalogger does not support autobaud mode.

**NOTE:** If a serial port is opened, it must be closed before changing the port baud rate.
