# SecondDim (Second Dimension)

The number of boundary level values too which the second Source element will be compared. The second dimension is separated into a set by the SecondDim argument. The SecondArray must have as many array elements as the numeric value of the SecondDim argument. If a one dimensional Level Crossing histogram is desired, this argument should be set to a value of 1, and the second array should be left empty. If a two dimensional LevelCrossing histogram is desired, then the SecondDim argument must be greater than one. The actual Boundary levels should be loaded into the SecondArray argument.

Type: Constant (or expression that evaluates as a constant)
