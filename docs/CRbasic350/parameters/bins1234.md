# Bins

Defines the number of bins or subranges to include in the histogram bin select range. The total number of bins (subranges) will be equal to the product of Bin1, Bin2, Bin3, Bin4. The width of each subrange is equal to the BinSelect range (UpLim - LoLim) divided by the number of bins.

If all four dimensions are used then the output will be linearized. Since the OS only keeps three dimensions internally, the output must be linearized to successfully pass the table definitions to datalogger support software.

- **Bins1 **: The row-wise number of bins to include in the histogram.

- ** Bins2 **: The column-wise number of bins to include in the histogram.

- ** Bins3 **: The 3rd dimension number of bins to include in the histogram.

- ** Bins4**: The 4th dimension number of bins to include in the histogram.

Type: Constant (or expression that evaluates as a constant)
