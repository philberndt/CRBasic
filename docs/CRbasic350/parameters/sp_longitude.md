# Longitude

A constant or variable that provides the longitude for the datalogger station, expressed in decimal degrees east of the Greenwich meridian. For longitudes measured going west from the Greenwich meridian, a negative value can be entered or a corrected value (360 WestDegrees) can be used. For example, Tokyo, Japan has a longitude of 220.3 when measured going west. This could be entered as -220.3, or the corrected longitude value of 139.7 degrees East could be used.
