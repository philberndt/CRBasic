# ExmV (Excitation Voltage in mV)

The excitation voltage in millivolts. The allowable range is +150 to +2500 mV for all bridge measurements. For the ExciteV() instruction, the range is +150 to +5000 when powered via an external battery (when powered via USB, it is +150 to +2500 mV).

Type: Constant. For ExciteV() only, this parameter can also be a Variable.
