# Security

The security code of the remote datalogger. 0 is entered for this parameter if no security is set in the destination datalogger.

Type: Integer

If security is enabled, it must be unlocked to level 3.

**NOTE:** If other data logger security settings, such as TCP password and PakBus Encryption are set, these must also match between remote and local data loggers for successful data logger to data logger communications to occur.
