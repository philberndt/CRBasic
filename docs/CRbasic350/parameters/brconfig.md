| 6                          | Full-bridge strain gage. Half the bridge has two gages parallel to +ɛ and -nɛ , and the other half to -nɛ and +ɛ1: This example assumes that the bridge (shown above) is set up such that the strain is considered to be positive when the G1 and G4 strain gauges experience positive strain (tension) while the G2 and G3 strain gauges experience negative strain (compression). In other words, when G1 and G4 increase in resistance (while G2 and G3 decrease in resistance), the strain is considered to be positive. The default setting for the output was configured for this bridge setup, and the datalogger's output strain data will be positive when the G1 and G4 strain gauges experiences positive strain. If the excitation voltage polarity is reversed, the output polarity is reversed, or if the output data needs to be positive when the G2 and G3 strain gauges experience positive strain, then Reverse should be clicked on. |
