# NumLevels (Number of Crossing Levels)

The NumLevels argument determines the number of levels on which to count crossings. This is the number of bins in which to store the number of crossings for the associated level. The number of crossing levels that the first dimension has is set by the NumLevels argument. The Crossing Array must have as many array elements as the numeric value of the NumLevels argument.

Type: Constant (or expression that evaluates as a constant)
