# Accessing the Help System

The CRBasic Editor has been designed with an extensive help system. Typically, pressing F1 should provide help relative to where your cursor is located in the program. There are three types of help provided for each instruction and various ways to display this help.

## Complete Instruction Help

Complete help is provided for each instruction in the program. This help discusses the use of the instruction, the program syntax, and each parameter. Complete help can be accessed by highlighting an instruction in the Instruction Panel and clicking the **Help** button or F1, by clicking the **Help** button within the Parameter window, by pressing F1 with your cursor placed on an instruction in the Program Window, by searching the help index, or from the help Contents.

## Popup Help

The popup help provides information on a particular parameter. This help is accessed by pressing F1 with your cursor placed on a particular parameter of an instruction in the Program Window.

## Program Examples

Program examples are provided for each instruction. In most instances, these are written to be complete, fully-functioning programs. They should provide a general guideline for the use of the instruction. A program example for an instruction can be accessed from its main help topic via a link at the top of the page.
