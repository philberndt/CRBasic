# Tools Menu

Use **Tools** menu options to specify the files used in the CRBasic Editor and list shortcut keys and program labels. Note that many menu options also use the standard Windows shortcut keys. For a list of keyboard shortcuts, click the **Tools** menu and select **Show Keyboard Shortcuts**.

- ** Associate Files **: Associate one or more CRBasic program file types with the CRBasic Editor in the Windows operating system. Once a file type is associated, if a file with that extension is opened from Windows Explorer, it is opened with the CRBasic Editor. It is recommended you have administrative privileges on your computer to complete this action.

- ** Edit Instruction Categories **: Create custom categories. (Note: Default categories cannot be edited or deleted.)[For more information, seeWorking with Instruction Categories.](editinstructioncategories.md)

- ** Show Keyboard Shortcuts **: Display a list of keyboard shortcut keys that can be used in the CRBasic Editor.

- ** Show Tables **: Display a list of tables in the program along with the output interval (if known), a list of field names, and units for each variable if they have been assigned for each table. The program must be saved before table information can be displayed.

- ** Set Datalogger Type **: Display a list of dataloggers so the user can select the instruction set, compiler, and help files to use when the program extension is .DLD or .CRB (e.g., myprogram.DLD, or myprogram.CRB).

- ** Insert Symbol **: Insert Unicode symbols into your CRBasic program for use in Strings and [Units](../Instructions/units.md) declarations.

- ** Set Up Constant Customization Section **: Insert the comments required for the [Constant Customization](constantcustomization.md) section of the datalogger program.

- ** Customize Constants **: Display the constants that have been defined in the [Constant Customization](constantcustomization.md) section of the program. Values for the constants can be selected, and the program can be compiled to generate a program based on the constant selections.

- ** Open Display Settings File **: Open a previously saved display setting file.

- ** Save Display Settings File**: The look and feel of the CRBasic Editor can be changed from the default. The Font and Background can be changed, as well as the syntax highlighting. These changes can be saved to a file (with an`.ini`extension) using this option. The file can be reloaded on the same or different computer running CRBasic using the **Tools** menu,**Open Display Settings File** option.
