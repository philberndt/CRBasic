# Select Server

Use the **Select Server** option to specify the computer running the server software to which the client should connect. The window includes the following:

**Server Address **- The TCP/IP address of the computer running LoggerNet (or PC400) software, to which you are trying to connect. This must be the valid name of an existing computer or a TCP/IP address (in the form ###.###.###.### consisting of the IP network number, ###.###.###, and the host number, ###). If the software server resides on the same computer as the client, you can simply type in LocalHost for the server name.

** NOTE:**If you have used a command line argument to change LoggerNet s default port number, you must specify this alternate port number when entering the Server Address (for example, LocalHost:6700 or 192.168.7.123:6700).

- ** User Name **- Your user name on the software server.

- ** Password **- Your password for the software server.

The** User Name **and** Password **fields are required only if your server administrator has set up security on your system.

Each time you start the client, you are prompted to enter this information. However, you can save the login information by selecting the** Remember User Name and Password **check box, or you can select the** Automatically login to this server**check box to skip this window and use the information from the last session.
