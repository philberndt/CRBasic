# File Menu

Use **File** menu options to manage the files being edited. More than one file can be opened in the CRBasic Editor at once, allowing you to cut and paste instructions between programs. Note that many menu options also use the standard Windows shortcut keys. For a list of keyboard shortcuts, click the **Tools** menu and select **Show Keyboard Shortcuts**.

- ** New **: Select a datalogger type from the list of the datalogger types that have been set up, to open a new CRBasic program window for that datalogger. You can change the template that is opened by default for a datalogger using the [Template Menu](templatemenu.md).

- ** Open **: Displays a dialog box so that an existing file can be opened.

- ** Open as Read-Only **: Opens a copy of a program file in a read-only mode. In this mode, the file cannot be edited. However, you can copy text from a read-only file into another file. Read-only allows the same program to be opened twice once in regular view and once in read-only view.

- ** Close **: Closes the active file.

- ** Close All **: Closes all opened files.

- ** Save **: Saves the active file.

- ** Save As **: Saves the active file with a different name and/or location.

- ** Compile, Save and Send **: Saves the active file and send the file to a datalogger.[See alsoSending a Program to the Datalogger.](sendingaprogram.md)

- ** Save and Encrypt **: Encrypts the active file. Encrypted files can be compiled in the datalogger but cannot be read by a user.[See alsoEncryption (Encrypt/Decrypt).](../Instructions/encryption1.md)

- ** Print **: Print the active file.

- ** Print Preview **: Displays how the document will look when printed. Margins can be changed by typing in new values in the provided fields or by dragging the desired margin boundary to a new location.

- ** Recent File List **: The four most recent files that have been edited are displayed at the bottom of the File menu for quick access.

- ** Exit **: Exits the CRBasic Editor. Youwill be prompted to save any files that have been edited but not saved.

** NOTE:**The "active file" is the file that has focus in the CRBasic Editor; it is the file that is in front of other files.
