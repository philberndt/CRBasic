# Pick CR200 Compiler

When this menu option is selected, the CRBasic Editor searches for and displays a list of all CR200 compilers installed on the computer in a specific directory. From this list you can choose the compiler to use when the program file is compiled and the binary (\*.bin) file is created. It is important that the compiler being used match the operating system version in the datalogger. If a different compiler is used, the program send will fail in the CR200.
