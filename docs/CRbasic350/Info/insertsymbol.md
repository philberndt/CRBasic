# Inserting Symbols

Click the Tools menu and select **Insert Symbol** to insert Unicode characters into the CRBasic program. The most common use for these characters within a program is to specify units for a variable.

CRBasic Editor comes with several predefined Unicode characters. These can be selected for use in the program by choosing one from the **Select Unicode character** drop-down list and clicking **Insert at Cursor**. The symbol selected in the drop-down list is inserted at the cursor position within the CRBasic program. For a list of unicode characters, see<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters>.

If there are Unicode characters you wish to use that do not appear in the list, they can be added to the program by typing the appropriate Unicode code point into the ** Enter Unicode code point**box and selecting the ** Insert at Cursor**button. The ** Unicode character preview**box will display the character associated with the Unicode code point, which is inserted at the cursor position.

If one or more hand-entered Unicode characters are used on a regular basis, they can be added to the drop-down list by typing them into the code point box and selecting ** Add to List**. Conversely, a character can be deleted from the drop-down list by selecting it and choosing ** Delete from List**.

Unicode code point tables are available by searching on the Internet.
