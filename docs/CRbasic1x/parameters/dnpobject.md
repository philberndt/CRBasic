# DNPObject (DNP Object)

The DNPObject parameter assigns the Source parameter to a specific DNP object type. DNP data is organized into arrays with different Object types. The Objects are divided into groups and each group has variations of that group. All communications are referenced from the DNP master. For example the Analog Input object means the Master is requesting data from a datalogger DNP outstation array.
