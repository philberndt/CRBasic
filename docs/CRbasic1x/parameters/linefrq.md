# LineFrq (Line Frequency)

The expected line frequency in hertz. Valid entries are 60, 50, or a value between 2 and 20. A value between 2 and 20 indicates measurements from variable-frequency power, where LineFrq is the minimum frequency to be measured. Note that smaller values for LineFrq increase the measurement and processing time for this instruction. The maximum frequency for the variable-frequency mode is 480 Hz and independent of the 2- to 20-Hz minimum frequency.

Type: Constant
