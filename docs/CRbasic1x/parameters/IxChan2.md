# IexChan (Excitation Channel)

The excitation channel (X1, X2, etc.) to use for the first measurement. The number of available channels depends upon the CDM being programmed. Right-click the parameter for a list of valid options.

If the Reps parameter is greater than 1, the excitation channel used for subsequent measurements will be incremented with each measurement based on the MeasPEx parameter.
