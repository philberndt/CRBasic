# TXDelay (Time to Delay)

Specifies the amount of time to delay, in microseconds, before outputting strings. A delay may be necessary in some situations, such as half duplex RF media.

When communicating with an SDC device on a port other than SDC7 or SDC8, the TXDelay parameter applies a delay both after addressing the SDC device and before resetting the SDC device.

Type: Variable or Constant
