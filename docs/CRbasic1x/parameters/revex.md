# RevEx (Reverse Excitation)

A constant is entered for the RevEx argument to determine whether the excitation should be reversed and applied to the sensor after the first measurement is made. False (or 0) = Do not reverse excitation ; True (or 1) = Reverse excitation and make a second measurement (requires more time to complete). Use of RevEx cancels out voltage offsets due to the sensor, wiring, and excitation circuitry, but does not compensate for operational input voltage errors.

Type: Constant
