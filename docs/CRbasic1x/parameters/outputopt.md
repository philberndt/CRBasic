# OutputOpt

A numeric code that is used to select one of the five different output options. The selected option will be applied to all of the INT8 channels. A brief explanation is given below for each code. See the INT8 manual for detailed explanations of each option. Right click the parameter to display a drop-down list box.

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ------------------- | --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 0     | Stores an average of the event data since the last time that the INT8 was interrogated by the datalogger. If no edges were detected, 0 will be returned for frequency and count functions, and 99999 will be returned for the other functions. The INT8 ceases to capture events during communications with the datalogger, thus some edges may be lost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32768 | Performs continuous averaging, which is utilized when input frequencies have a slower period than the execution interval of the datalogger. If an edge was not detected for a channel since the last time that the INT8 was polled, then the datalogger will not update the input location for that channel. The INT8 will capture events even during communications with the datalogger.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| nnnn  | Averages the input values over "nnnn" milliseconds. The datalogger program is delayed by this instruction while the INT8 captures and processes the edges for the specified time duration and sends the results back to the datalogger. If no edges were detected, 0 will be returned for frequency and count functions, and 99999 will be returned for the other functions                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -nnnn | Instructs the INT8 to capture all events until "nnnn" edges have occurred on channel 1, until the datalogger addresses the INT8 with the CaptureTrig argument true, or until 8000 events have been captured. When the CaptureTrig argument is true, the INT8 will return up to the last nnnn events for each of the programmed INT8 channels, reset its memory, and begin capturing the next nnnn events. The INT8 waits for the first edge on channel 1 as a trigger to start making measurements. The Dest parameter must be dimensioned large enough to receive the captured events. |
| -9999 | Initiates a self memory test of the INT8. A numeric code is returned to indicate the results of the test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Code | Description |     | --- | --- |     | 0   | Bad ROM |     | -0  | Bad ROM and bad RAM |     | positive integer | Good ROM (value returned is the ROM signature) and good RAM |     | negative integer | Good ROM (value returned is the ROM signature) and bad RAM |     |
