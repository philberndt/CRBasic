# MeasPerPort (Number of Terminals for CS616)

The number of control terminals to be used to control the CS616 sensor(s). If Reps is set to 4:

- MeasPerPort = 4 will result in the same terminal being used for all measurements.

- MeasPerPort = 1 will result in four sequential ports being used for the measurements.

- MeasPerPort = 2 will result in one port being used for the first two measurements, and the next port being used for the next two measurements.
