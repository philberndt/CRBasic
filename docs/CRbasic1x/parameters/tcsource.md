A two-dimensional array that holds a binary value to be sent to the SDMCD16 to determine the port to be set and the duration (number of scans) the value should be used. For Array(x,y), x is the binary value determining the port and y is the number of scans. X should be dimensioned to at least the size of the Size parameter.

Type: Two dimensional Variable Array.
