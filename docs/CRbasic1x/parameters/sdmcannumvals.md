# NumVals

The NumVals parameter defines the number of values (beginning with the value stored in the Dest array) that will be transferred to or from the datalogger during one operation. For each value transferred, the Number of Bits (NumBits) will be added to the Start Bit number so that multiple values can be read from or stored to one data frame.
