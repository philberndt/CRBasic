# ResonAmp (Resonant Amperage)

Holds the desired output voltage amplitude of the steady-state resonant response of the sensor in units of Volts. This parameter is dimensioned to two for the CDM-VW300 and eight for the VWIRE 305 or CDM-VW305. For each element of the array, enter the voltage for the corresponding channel number. The default value is 0.002V.

Type: Variable
