# NumCases

The number of worst cases" to store. A separate table is created for each worst case. The tables use the name of the DataTable with a two-digit number appended to the end (i.e., a table called Temp's WorstCase tables will be named Temp01, Temp02, Temp03 ). The numbers give the tables unique names, they have no relationship to the ranking of the events.
