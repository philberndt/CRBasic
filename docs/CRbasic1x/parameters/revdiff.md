# Reverse Differential (RevDiff)

A constant value is entered to determine whether the inputs are reversed and a second measurement made. This removes any voltage offset errors due to the datalogger measurement circuitry, includingoperationalinputvoltageerrors. Enabling this parameter doubles the measurement time.Measurement time will increase four times if RevEx is used.Right-click to display a list.

| False or 0 | Signal is measured with the high side referenced to the low. Do not make second measurement. |
| True or 1  | Reverse input and make second measurement.                                                   |
