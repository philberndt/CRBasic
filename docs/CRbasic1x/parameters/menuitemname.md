# MenuItemName

The name that will be displayed on the custom menu for a measurement or datatable value. The name is limited to 512 characters, including characters for the associated measurement value. However, its practical size is much less because of the small size of the keyboard display. MenuItemName should be enclosed in quotation marks.

Type: Text, Variable, or Constant
