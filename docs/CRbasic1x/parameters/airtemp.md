# AirTemp (Air Temperature)

The variable that holds a temperature measurement in degrees C that will be used in calcuating the solar position.

NANs may occur in the output array for Zenith angles if a temperature measurement is not used. If temperature is unavailable, consider using the datalogger's panel temperature (though this may affect accuracy of the instruction).

Type: Variable
