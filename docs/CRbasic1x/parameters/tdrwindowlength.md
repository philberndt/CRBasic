# WindowLength

Specifies the length, in meters, of the waveform to collect or analyze. The waveform begins at the CableLength and ends at the CableLength + WindowLength. This is an apparent length because the value set for Vp may not be the actual propagation velocity. For water content measurements, the WindowLength must be large enough to contain the entire probe reflection for probes with 20 to 30 cm rods. A Vp = 1 and Window length = 5 is recommended.

Type: Constant or Variable
