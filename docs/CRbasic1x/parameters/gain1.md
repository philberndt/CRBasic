# Gain

Used to set the voltage gain for the input signal prior to going into the zero crossing comparator. Enter the code for the desired option.

| Code | Gain | Min Signal (peak-to-peak) | Max Signal (peak-to-peak) |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 0    | 1    | 500                       | 20                        |
| 1    | 3.8  | 50                        | 20                        |
| 2    | 19   | 10                        | 20                        |
| 3    | 66   | 2                         | 20                        |
