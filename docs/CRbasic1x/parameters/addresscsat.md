# Address (Address of CSAT3B)

Identifies the unique address of the CSAT3B on the communication bus. ForSDM

**Note:** Synchronous Device for Measurement. A processor-based peripheral device or sensor that communicates with the datalogger via hardwire over a short distance using a protocol proprietary to Campbell Scientific.

, valid addresses are 1 through 14. ForCPI

**Note:** CPI is a proprietary interface for communications between Campbell Scientific dataloggers and Campbell Scientific CDM peripheral devices. It consists of a physical layer definition and a data protocol. CDM devices are similar to Campbell Scientific SDM devices in concept, but the use of the CPI bus enables higher data-throughput rates and use of longer cables. CDM devices require more power to operate in general than do SDM devices.

, valid addresses are 1 through 120.
