# SteinA, SteinB, SteinC (Steinhart-Hart Equation Coefficients)

The coefficients to use for A, B, and C in the Steinhart-Hart equation for calculating the thermistor temperature (degrees Celsius) for each channel of the CDM device. This parameter is dimensioned to two for the CDM-VW300 and eight for the VWIRE 305 or CDM-VW305. For each element of the array, enter the desired coefficients for the respective channel number. To output Ohms from the thermistor, set the parameters to **0**.
