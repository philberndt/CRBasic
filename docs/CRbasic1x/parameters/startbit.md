# StartBit

Used to identify the least significant bit of the data value within the CAN data frame to which the instruction relates. The bit number can range from 1 to 64 (there are 64 bits in a CAN data frame). The SDM-CAN adheres to the ISO standard where the least significant bit is referenced to the right most bit of the data frame. If a negative value is entered, the least significant bit is referenced to the left most bit of the data frame.
