# WaveAvg

Used to define the number of waveform reflections averaged by the TDR100/200 to give a single result. A waveform averaging value of 4 provides good signal-to-noise ratio under typical applications. Under high noise conditions averaging can be increased. The maximum averaging possible is 128.

Type: Constant or Variable
