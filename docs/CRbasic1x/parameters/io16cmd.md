| 91   | Read state of ports 1-16 into one variable (Dest). The result is a 16-bit decimal representation from 0-65535.                                                                                      |
| 92   | Read state of ports 1-16 into 16 separate variables (Dest must be dimensioned to 16). Dest(1) holds the state of port 1, Dest(2) port 2, etc. State is represented by 0 or 1.                       |
| 93   | Set state of ports 1-16 from a single variable (Dest). Dest should be a 16-bit decimal representation from 0-65535.                                                                                 |
| 94   | Set state of ports 1-16 from 16 separate variables (Dest must be dimensioned to 16). Dest(1) sets the state of port 1, Dest(2) port 2, etc. State is represented by 0 or 1.                         |
| 95   | Set direction of ports 1-16 from a single variable (Dest). Dest should be a 16-bit decimal representation from 0-65535.                                                                             |
| 96   | Set direction of ports 1-16 from 16 separate variables (Dest must be dimensioned to 16). Dest(1) sets the direction of port 1, Dest(2) port 2, etc. Direction is represented by 0 or 1.             |
| 97   | Set interrupt mask of ports 1-16 from a single variable (Dest). Dest should be a 16-bit decimal representation from 0-65535.                                                                        |
| 98   | Set interrupt mask of ports 1-16 from 16 separate variables (Dest should be dimensioned to 16). Dest(1) sets port 1, Dest(2) port 2, etc. The mask is represented by 0 or 1.                        |
| 99   | Read the OS signature, OS version and counters for watchdog resets and communication errors into 4 separate variables (Dest must be dimensioned to 4). Using this command also resets the counters. |
