# ChanI (Current Measurement Channel)

The single-ended channel for the current measurement. For single-phase configurations (ConfigAC = 1) with RepsI greater than 1, the datalogger makes multiple current measurements on increasing consecutive channels starting at ChanI. For split-phase configurations (ConfigAC = 2), the datalogger makes two current measurements on increasing consecutive channels starting at ChanI. For three-phase configurations (ConfigAC = 3), the datalogger makes three current measurements on increasing consecutive channels starting at ChanV.

Type: Constant
