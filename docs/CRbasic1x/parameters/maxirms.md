# MaxIrms (Maximum RMS Current)

The expected maximumRMS

**Note:** Root-mean square, or quadratic mean. A measure of the magnitude of wave or other varying quantities around zero.

current to measure. MaxIrms is specified at the primary of the current transformer, or equivalently, the non-logger side of the current transformer. The datalogger uses MultI and MaxIrms to calculate which input range to use for the current measurement(s).

Type: Constant
