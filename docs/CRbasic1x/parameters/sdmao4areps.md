# Reps

Determines the number of SDM-AO4A output channels that will be set. If this parameter is greater than four (i.e., voltage is being set for more than one SDM-AO4 device), voltage is set on the next consecutively addressed SDM-AO4A device. In this case, the SDM-AO4As must have sequential SDM addresses.

Type: Constant integer (or expression that evaluates as a constant).
