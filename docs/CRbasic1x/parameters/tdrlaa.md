# TDRLaa

Allows the user to select the desired algorithm that the TDR200 will use to determine the end of the probe (2nd reflection). The following algorithms are available:

| 0    | Legacy Algorithm. This algorithm is similar to that used in the TDR100 and uses the 2nd derivative of the waveform to detect inflection points. This is a simple method that is consistent over varying soils and water contents. It will yield the same values as those given by the TDR100. This algorithm has difficulty in electrically noisy environments (nearby radios, motors, fluorescent and LED lighting) or when the length of probes are short.                                                                                      |
| 1    | Tangent Line Method. This algorithm uses the flatline method made popular in the WinTDR software package. This method works well without any predefined waveform attributes and has the advantage of being more resistant to noisy environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2    | Second-Order Bounded Mean Oscillation (BMO) Method. The second-order BMO method has been developed to aid in researchers using short probes with non-smooth lines (Wang et al., 2014). When this method is selected, PCTDR uses a combined approach of both tangent line and second-order BMO methods (Wang et al., 2016). This combined method uses the tangent line to narrow in on the region of the waveform where the second reflection appears and then uses the second-order BMO method to finalize the point representing the probe s end |
