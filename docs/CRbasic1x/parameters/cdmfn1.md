# fN1 (First Notch Frequency)

Determines the lowest frequency that will be eliminated or notched out by the sinc filter. This filter notches out frequencies at integer multiples of fN1by averaging for a time equal to 1/fN1; thus, lower fN1frequencies result in longer measurement times. Any value between 2.5 Hz and 30,000 Hz can be entered, but the value entered will be rounded to the nearest of the frequencies below. The three most common noise filtering options are listed first.
