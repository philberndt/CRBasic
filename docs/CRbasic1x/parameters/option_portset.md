# Option

Optional parameter that determines whether the instruction will run in the measurement task sequence or the processing task sequence; also affects whether the program will compile and run in [SequentialMode or PipelineMode](../Instructions/sequentialmodepipeli2.md):

| Option  | Description                                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Omitted | Instruction is run within the measurement task sequence; program will compile in SequentialMode            |
| 0       | Instruction is run within the measurement task sequence; program will attempt to compile in PipelineMode\* |
| 1       | Instruction is run within the processing task sequence; program will attempt to compile in PipelineMode\*  |

\* other programming may force the program into SequentialMode
