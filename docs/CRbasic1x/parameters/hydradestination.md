# HydraDestination

The variable array (dimensioned to 11) that will hold the values returned from the Hydra Probe sensor. The sensor returns the following measurements: soil type (1 = sand, 2 = silt, 3 = clay, 4 = loam), real dielectric constant, imagined dielectric constant, temperature, real dielectric constant with temperature correction, imagined dielectric constant with temperature correction, water content (fraction by volume), salinity (grams of NaCl per liter), soil conductivity (S/m), soil conductivity with temperature correction (S/m), soil water conductivity with temperature correction (S/m).

Type: Variable dimensioned to 11
