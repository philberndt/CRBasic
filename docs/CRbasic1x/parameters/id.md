# ID

Each device on a CAN-bus network prefaces its data frames with an 11 or 29 bit identifier. The ID parameter is used to set this address. The ID is entered as a single decimal equivalent. Enter a positive value to signify a 29 bit ID or a negative value to signify an 11 bit ID. Any value < -2047 will set the ID to an 11 bit ID of 0.
