# RInterval (Time between Random Transmissions)

Used to define the average time between random transmissions. The value is a constant string entered in the format of "Hours_Minutes_Seconds". Typically the assigned interval is in hours, so the minutes and seconds parameters are left at 0 (example, "1_0_0" sets up an hourly interval). Maximum interval is 24 hours; minimum interval is 5 minutes.
