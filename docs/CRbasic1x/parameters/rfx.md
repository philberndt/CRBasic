# RFx (Rainflow Histogram Arrays)

Two-dimensional arrays in which to store the rainflow histogram for each channel measured on the device. The first dimension is the number of Mean bins and the second dimension is the number of amplitude bins. For the CDM-VW300, only two variable arrays are required (RF1 and RF2); for the VWIRE 305 or CDM-VW305 eight variable arrays are required (RF1 RF8).

Type: Two-dimensional variable array
