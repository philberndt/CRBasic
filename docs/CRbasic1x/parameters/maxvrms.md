# MaxVrms (Maximum RMS Voltage)

The expected maximumRMS

**Note:** Root-mean square, or quadratic mean. A measure of the magnitude of wave or other varying quantities around zero.

voltage to measure. MaxVrms is specified at the primary of the potential transformer, or equivalently, the non-logger side of the potential transformer. Typical values are 120 or 240. The datalogger uses MultV and MaxVrms to calculate which input range to use for the voltage measurement.

Type: Constant
