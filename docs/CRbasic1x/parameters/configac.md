| 1      | Single-phase with one voltage measurement and the number of current measurements specified by the RepsI parameter. This configuration monitors a single load with one voltage and one current measurement, or multiple loads in sub-panel applications with one voltage and multiple current measurements. | (Click image to expand/collapse display) |
| 2      | Split-phase with one voltage measurement and two current measurements. This configuration is typical of residential service-entry panels, as well as residential and commercial distribution panels. Split-phase configurations have two line (or hot ) conductors plus a neutral conductor.               | (Click image to expand/collapse display) |
| 3      | Three-phase Y , four-conductor, configurations with three voltage measurements and three current measurements. This configuration is typical of commercial entry panels and commercial distribution panels. The four conductors are three line (or hot ) conductors plus a neutral conductor.              | (Click image to expand/collapse display) |
