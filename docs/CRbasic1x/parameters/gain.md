# Gain

Used to set the voltage gain for the input signal prior to going into the zero crossing comparator. Maximum frequency decreases with increasing gain. Enter the code for the desired option.

| Code | Gain | Min Signal (peak-to-peak) | Max Signal (peak-to-peak) | Min Pulse-Width ( s) | Max Frequency (kHz) |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0    | 1    | 500 mV                    | 10 V                      | 2.5                  | 200                 |
| 1    | 2.5  | 50 mV                     | 2 V                       | 10                   | 50                  |
| 2    | 12.5 | 10 mV                     | 2 V                       | 62                   | 8                   |
| 3    | 64   | 2 mV                      | 2 V                       | 100                  | 5                   |
