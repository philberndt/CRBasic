# CommsMode

This optional parameter is left blank when used with the [SDM-SIO1A or SDM-SIO4A](../Instructions/sdmsio1a_sdmsio4a.md). The CommsMode specifies the configuration of the datalogger's control port used by this instruction. The ports can also be configured using Device Configuration Utility. Configuring the ports using the SerialOpen instruction will change the setting if it was previously set by other means.

**NOTE:** Codes 6 and 7 are available on CR1000Xe data loggers and CR1000X models with OS versions later than v.7.02.

**TIP:** RS-422 protocol is similar to RS-485. Most RS-422 sensors will work with RS-485 protocol.
