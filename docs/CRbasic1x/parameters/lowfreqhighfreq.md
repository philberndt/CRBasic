# LowFreq, HighFreq (Lower and Upper Bounds of Resonant Frequency)

Sets the lower and upper bounds of the resonant frequency expected on the sensor. The parameters are dimensioned to two for the CDM-VW300 and eight for the VWIRE 305 or CDM-VW305. Valid ranges depend upon the scan rate, according to the following:

| Sample Rate | Min Frequency | Max Frequency |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 20 Hz       | 290 Hz        | 6000 Hz       |
| 50 Hz       | 290 Hz        | 6000 Hz       |
| 100 Hz      | 580 Hz        | 6000 Hz       |
| 200 Hz      | 1150 Hz       | 6000 Hz       |
| 333 Hz      | 2300 Hz       | 6000 Hz       |

Type: Variable
