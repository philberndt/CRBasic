# SDMAddress (Address of Device)

Defines the address of the device with which to communicate. ValidSDM

**Note:** Synchronous Device for Measurement. A processor-based peripheral device or sensor that communicates with the datalogger via hardwire over a short distance using a protocol proprietary to Campbell Scientific.

addresses are 0 through 14. Address 15 is reserved for the SDMTrigger instruction.

Some SDM instructions support repetitions. If a Reps parameter is present and it is greater than 1, the data logger will increment the SDM address used in the instruction for each subsequent device with which it communicates.
