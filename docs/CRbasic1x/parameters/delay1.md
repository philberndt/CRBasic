# Delay

The amount of time, in microseconds, to delay before moving on to the next instruction. Excitation is turned off after the specified delay. If the Delay is set to 0 (default), the datalogger will apply the desired excitation and immediately move to the next instruction without turning excitation off. The excitation will be held until the end of the program scan or until another instruction sets an excitation.

Type: Constant (or expression that evaluates as a constant)
