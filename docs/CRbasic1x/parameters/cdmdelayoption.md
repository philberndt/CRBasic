| 0    | Delay will affect the measurement task sequence. Processing will continue to take place as needed in the background. When this option is chosen, the Delay instruction must not be placed in a conditional statement. |
| 1    | Delay will affect processing. Measurements will continue as called for by the task sequencer.                                                                                                                         |
