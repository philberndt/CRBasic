| 0    | Beacon **Note:** A signal broadcasted to other devices in a PakBus network to identify "neighbor" devices. A beacon in a PakBus network ensures that all devices in the network are aware of other devices that are viable. If configured to do so, a clock-set command may be transmitted with the beacon. This function can be used to synchronize the clocks of devices within the PakBus network. . When a Beacon is transmitted, all PakBus devices within range will respond and become a neighbor to the beaconing datalogger. The only exception is if a device in range has a neighbor filter that prevents it from responding. |

Resets the routing tables of the dataloggers in the PakBus network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13   | GoodBye. Removes the datalogger from the neighbor list of other devices in the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 14   | Hello request. A Hello request sets up other devices as neighbors to the datalogger sending the message. Routing information, hop metrics, communication verification intervals, and router indication are exchanged in a Hello request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
