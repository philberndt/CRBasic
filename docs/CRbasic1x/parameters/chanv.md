# ChanV (Channel for Voltage Measurement)

The single-ended channel for the voltage measurement. For single- and split-phase configurations (ConfigAC = 1 or 2), the datalogger makes a voltage measurement at ChanV. For three-phase configurations (ConfigAC = 3), the datalogger makes three voltage measurements on increasing consecutive channels starting at ChanV.

Type: Constant
