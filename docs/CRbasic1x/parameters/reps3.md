Specifies how many values to calibrate. Reps must be set to 1 or the number of elements in the MeasureVar array. When Reps is equal to the size of the MeasureVar parameter, all elements of the MeasureVar array will be calibrated in a single scan. When Reps is set to 1, the element of the MeasureVar specified by the Index parameter will be calibrated.
