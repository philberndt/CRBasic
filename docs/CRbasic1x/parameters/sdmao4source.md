The variable or variable array that holds the voltage(s), in millivolts, that will be sent to the SDM-AO4(s). If multiple SDM-AO4s are to be triggered with one instruction, this parameter must be dimensioned to the total number of channels for all the devices being set (e.g., if all four channels are being set on two SDM-AO4 devices, Source must be dimensioned to eight).

Type: Variable of variable array
