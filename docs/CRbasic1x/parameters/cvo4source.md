# CVO4Source

A variable array that holds the values for the voltages (millivolts) or currents (microamps) that will be output by each channel of the device (Source(1) sets channel1, Source(2) sets channel2, etc.). When outputting a voltage, the variable must be within the range of 0 to 10,000. When outputting a current, the variable must be within the range of 0 to 20,000.

Type: Variable array
