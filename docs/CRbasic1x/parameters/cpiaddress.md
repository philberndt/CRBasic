# CPIAddress (CPI Address)

TheCPI

**Note:** CPI is a proprietary interface for communications between Campbell Scientific dataloggers and Campbell Scientific CDM peripheral devices. It consists of a physical layer definition and a data protocol. CDM devices are similar to Campbell Scientific SDM devices in concept, but the use of the CPI bus enables higher data-throughput rates and use of longer cables. CDM devices require more power to operate in general than do SDM devices.

address configured in theCDM **Note:** module. Valid range is 1 through 120. Note that the CPIAddress cannot be a variable because the datalogger must know all information for a given CDM module at program compile.(e.g., before the program runs).
