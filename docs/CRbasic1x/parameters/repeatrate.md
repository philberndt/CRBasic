# RepeatRate (Repeat Rate)

The amount of time, in seconds, between each packet being sent. Valid rates are 0 through 255, or enter a negative number to use the default repetition rate for the PTT. Note that the transmitter adds 42 seconds to the rate entered for this parameter (so if 0 is entered, the rate will be 42).
