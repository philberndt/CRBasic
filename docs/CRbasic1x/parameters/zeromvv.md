# ZeromV/V (Zero mV/V)

For Zero calibration, this parameter is the variable or variable array that will be populated with the zero mV/V values. It should be dimensioned large enough to hold values for all of the Reps of the source MeasureVar array. If ZeromV/V is a NAN, it will be set to 0 during the calibration process.

ZeromV/V is not used for shunt calibration. Enter 0

Type: Variable or variable array
