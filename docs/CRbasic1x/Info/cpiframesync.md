# CPI Frame Sync

A CDM or VOLT module communicates with a datalogger via a CPI (CAN Peripheral Interface) bus. CDM or VOLT measurements are made in parallel with the datalogger when running in PipeLineMode. To ensure that the correct amount of data is sent from a given module, the datalogger sends a hardware frame sync about every 0.5 sec or a max of 50 scans. For scan intervals > 100mS, a frame sync is sent every scan. Until this frame sync is detected, the datalogger cannot process any data from that module. If a scan is running faster than 0.5 sec there will be multiple scan intervals that pass before the data can be processed. This results in several scans being processed at once, which can be problematic when doing control or output. Setting the Scan BuffOption to 2 results in a CPI frame sync on every scan which will force data to be processed immediately upon reception and will allow any control/output to take place immediately.
