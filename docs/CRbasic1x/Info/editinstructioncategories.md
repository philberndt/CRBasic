# Working with Instruction Categories

A list of predefined categories of instructions is available in the Instruction Panel on the right-side of the CRBasic Editor window (under the **Search** box). These categories are used to filter the instructions based on instruction type (for example,**All** instructions,**Data Table/Output Processing** instructions, etc.). When an option is selected from the list is selected, only those instructions in that category are visible. You can also create one or more custom lists of instructions (for example, a list of instructions that you use most often).

## Creating Custom Lists of Instructions

4. Select the instructions to include in your category and click **OK**.

## Editing and Deleting Custom Categories
