# Instruction Menu

Use **Instruction** menu options to customize the appearance and functionality of the CRBasic Editor's editing features. Note that these menu options also use the function keys.

- **Edit Instruction at Cursor**: When the cursor is placed on an instruction that has one or more parameters and this option is selected, the Parameter Editing window will appear. If the cursor is placed on a parameter, a list of options or a list of variables is displayed if either exists, or help for that parameter is displayed. The function key for this feature is **F2**.

- **Edit Instruction Defaults**: Allows you to edit the default parameter for an instruction that is highlighted in the Instruction Panel. The function key for this feature is **F4**.

- **Select Instruction**: Toggles the focus of the cursor between the Instruction Panel and the program editing window. The function key for this feature is **F8**.

- **Insert Variable**: Displays a pick list that contains all of the variables, aliases, and constants that have been defined in the program. If an item is selected from this pick list, it will be inserted in the program at the cursor location. This list can also be displayed by pressing **F9**.

- **Replace Variable**: This option is similar to **Insert Variable**, except that it replaces an existing item rather than adding the new item to whatever text exists. This list can also be displayed by pressing **F10** or by right-clicking a parameter that is defined by the editor as using a variable for input.

- **Insert User Function**: Displays a list that contains all user-defined functions found in the program. (See [Function/EndFunction](../Instructions/functionendfunction.md) for dataloggers that support user-defined functions.) The short cut key for displaying this list is **F11**.
