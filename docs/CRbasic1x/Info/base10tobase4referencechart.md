# Base 10 to Base 4 Reference Chart

CRBasic dataloggers use base 10 when addressingSDM

**Note:** Synchronous Device for Measurement. A processor-based peripheral device or sensor that communicates with the datalogger via hardwire over a short distance using a protocol proprietary to Campbell Scientific devices. Edlog programmed dataloggers (e.g., CR10X, CR23X) used base 4 for addressing.
