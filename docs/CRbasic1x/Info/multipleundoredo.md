# Multiple Undo / Redo

The **Multiple Undo** window displays a list of all keystrokes and actions that can be "undone" until the list is cleared. Changes are listed in the reverse order that they were made, with the most recent change as the first entry in the list. A single change or a range of changes can be selected to "undo".

The **Multiple Redo** window works similarly.

An option in the Editor Preferences window determines when the list is cleared. If **Clear Undo/Redo List on File Save** is enabled, the list is cleared each time the file is saved. Otherwise, the list is cleared when the file is closed.
